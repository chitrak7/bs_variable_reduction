function of alpha dependence of result
do not update y, just check it to check benefit
also check for multiple value of alpha>2 (bimodality)
p overestimation
sd in theta and alpha
variance with alpha and beta

em in geometric skew normal

stabilise using tranformation s.t c1*log(d1) nd c2*(logd2) have same varieance.
